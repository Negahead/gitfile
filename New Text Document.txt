=============================================chat bot====================================================================
A chatbot (sometimes referred to as a chatterbot) is a computer program that attempts to simulate the conversation or "chatter" of a human being via text or voice interactions. A user can ask a chatbot a question or make a command, and the chatbot responds or performs the requested action.

Chatbots can be thought of as the spokesperson for artificial intelligence (AI). It's an accessible form of AI that is commonly put to use in businesses across sales and service departments and in the consumer app and device market.


How chatbots work
Chatbots such as ELIZA and PARRY were early attempts at creating programs that could at least temporarily fool a real human being into thinking they were having a conversation with another person. PARRY's effectiveness was benchmarked in the early 1970s using a version of a Turing test; testers only made the correct identification of human vs. chatbot at a level consistent with making a random guess.

Chatbots have come a long way since then. They are built on AI technologies, including deep learning, natural language processing and  machine learning algorithms, and require massive amounts of data. The more an end user interacts with the bot, the better voice recognition becomes at predicting what the appropriate response is when communicating with an end user.

Chatbots can be stateless or stateful. A stateless chatbot approaches each interaction as if it was with a new user. A stateful chatbot is more sophisticated; it can review past interactions and frame new responses in context.

Adding a chatbot to a company's service or sales department today requires little coding, because there are a number of chatbot service providers that allow developers to build conversational interfaces for any business application.


Examples of chatbot uses
Chatbot use is on the rise, both in the business and consumer markets. As chatbots get better, consumers have less to quarrel about in interacting with them. Between advanced technology and a societal transition to more passive, text-based communication, chatbots help fill a niche that phone calls used to fill.

Chatbots have been used in instant messaging (IM) applications and online interactive games for many years but have recently segued into business-to-consumer (B2C) and business-to-business (B2B) sales and services. Chatbots can be added to a buddy list or provide a single game player with an entity to interact with while awaiting other "live" players. If the bot is sophisticated enough to pass the Turing test, the person may not even know they are interacting with a computer program.

In sales, chatbots are being used to assist consumers shopping online, either by answering noncomplex product questions or providing helpful information that the consumer could later search for, including shipping price and availability. Chatbots are also used in service departments, assisting service agents in answering repetitive requests. Once a conversation gets too complex for a chatbot, it will be transferred to a human service agent .

Chatbots are also in use as virtual assistants -- conversational assistants that help people navigate their daily lives. Apple, Amazon, Google and Microsoft all have forms of virtual assistants; apps, such as Apple's Siri and Microsoft's Cortana, or products, like Amazon's Echo with Alexa or Google Home, all play the part of personal chatbot.



========================machine learning=============================================
Machine learning is a subfield of artificial intelligence (AI). The goal of machine learning generally is to understand the structure of data and fit that data into models that can be understood and utilized by people.


Although machine learning is a field within computer science, it differs from traditional computational approaches. In traditional computing, algorithms are sets of explicitly programmed instructions used by computers to calculate or problem solve. Machine learning algorithms instead allow for computers to train on data inputs and use statistical analysis in order to output values that fall within a specific range. Because of this, machine learning facilitates computers in building models from sample data in order to automate decision-making processes based on data inputs.


Any technology user today has benefitted from machine learning. Facial recognition technology allows social media platforms to help users tag and share photos of friends. Optical character recognition (OCR) technology converts images of text into movable type. Recommendation engines, powered by machine learning, suggest what movies or television shows to watch next based on user preferences. Self-driving cars that rely on machine learning to navigate may soon be available to consumers.

machine learning, the application and science of algorithms that
make sense of data, is the most exciting field of all the computer sciences! We are
living in an age where data comes in abundance; using self-learning algorithms
from the field of machine learning, we can turn this data into knowledge. Thanks to
the many powerful open source libraries that have been developed in recent years,
there has probably never been a better time to break into the machine learning field
and learn how to utilize powerful algorithms to spot patterns in data and make
predictions about future events.


three types of machine learning: supervised
learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning.


The main goal in supervised learning is to learn a model from labeled training data
that allows us to make predictions about unseen or future data. Here, the term
supervised refers to a set of samples where the desired output signals (labels) are
already known.


Classification is a subcategory of supervised learning where the goal is to predict
the categorical class labels of new instances, based on past observations. Those
class labels are discrete, unordered values that can be understood as the group
memberships of the instances. The previously mentioned example of email spam
detection represents a typical example of a binary classification task, where the
machine learning algorithm learns a set of rules in order to distinguish between two
possible classes: spam and non-spam emails.


Another type of machine learning is reinforcement learning. In reinforcement
learning, the goal is to develop a system (agent) that improves its performance based
on interactions with the environment. Since the information about the current state
of the environment typically also includes a so-called reward signal, we can think
of reinforcement learning as a field related to supervised learning. However, in
reinforcement learning this feedback is not the correct ground truth label or value,
but a measure of how well the action was measured by a reward function. Through
its interaction with the environment, an agent can then use reinforcement learning to
learn a series of actions that maximizes this reward via an exploratory trial-and-error
approach or deliberative planning.
A popular example of reinforcement learning is a chess engine. Here, the
agent decides upon a series of moves depending on the state of the board (the
environment), and the reward can be defined as win or lose at the end of the game:

Deep Learning is a subfield of machine learning concerned with algorithms inspired by the structure and function of the brain called artificial neural networks.
